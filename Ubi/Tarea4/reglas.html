    <p>
        Mountain biking is an inherently risky activity. These Safety Rules are not a guarantee
        against injury or death to riders, spectators, or others. However, you can significantly
        reduce your risk by riding with skill and awareness, using high-quality protective gear,
        maintaining your equipment properly, and reporting unsafe conditions or behaviour to race officials.
    </p>

    <p>
        Riders are solely responsible for ensuring that their bicycles are fit for competition.
        Meeting minimum safety standards does not equal optimal protection.
